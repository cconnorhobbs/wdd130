        <p>Hello! My name is Connor Hobbs, and I'm from Tennessee. 
            I'm studying software engineering, and I enjoy
            pumping iron, crushing chumps at pickleball, 
            and baking apple pie that'll put your grandma to shame. I
            grew up in the church and served a spanish speaking mission in Utah. I am single.
        </p>
        <p>I defintely love the scripture John 14:27. The Savior talks about the peace He gives us and that means
            a lot to me.
        </p>
        <p>"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, 
            give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."
        </p>
